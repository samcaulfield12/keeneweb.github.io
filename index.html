<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Sam Caulfield. I am a sophomore here at Keene State. I am 19 years old. My hometown is Salem, Massachusetts.
I attended high school at Essex Technical High School in Danvers, Ma. This school is a vocational highschool where you choose a specific trade to study all 4 years. The shop that I chose was health assisting.

There they have me help with indexing recipts for each departments budget. When I am not at school I work at a fiancial advisoing office in Wakefield, MA.
